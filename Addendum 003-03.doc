Addendum 003-03:

During M03-Gloria procedures, SCP-003-1 doubled its mass and began rapid structural growth.
Temperature was immediately returned to 100°C. Growth and mass increase of SCP-003-1 continued for 9 minutes and 6 seconds,
at which time a sustained radiation spike was produced by SCP-003-2. In response,
SCP-003-1 returned to its normal state in 3 minutes and 39 seconds.
New growth dissolved into a dusty residue which was collected for analysis.
Both SCP-003-1 and SCP-003-2 ceased all detectable activity.
SCP-003-2 did not resume activity until connected to external power source.
SCP-003-2's runes glowed uniformly gray and did not resume normal activity for three (3) hours.
SCP-003-2 no longer appears to be able to maintain containment area at a temperature above 35°C without external power supplied by Generators 003-III through IX.
