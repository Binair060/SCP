Appendix A:

Mental Health Effects of SCP-004-12
All Class D personnel using SCP-004-12 return in a catatonic state, unable to speak.
Some may have enough energy left to try to claw out their eyes.
Of the 16 subjects, only 4 have survived.
Only one has regained speech, following long-term psychotherapy.
He was able to tell the psychiatrist that he saw a massive green creature,
so large that much of its body extended beyond his field of view.
He reported innate fear and sudden recognition,
“as if it were something buried deep in [his] primal fears,”
and forced implantation of “incomprehensible” memories.
Subject displays acute anterograde and retrograde amnesia.
