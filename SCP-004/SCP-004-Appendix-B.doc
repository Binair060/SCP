Appendix B: Additional Information

Item #: SCP-004-14

Date of Discovery: 09/02/1950

Origin of Object:
Object was discovered elsewhere in factory area, in the previously undiscovered manager's office.

Description:
Object appears as a large, unvarnished wooden box.
The box may be unlocked by the "safe" key, SCP-004-7, as well as five of the "unsafe" keys (see Document SCP-004-1).

Upon unlocking SCP-004-14 with SCP-004-7, the box opens automatically on hinges.
The volume of the space inside is precisely five times greater than the outer dimensions imply.
Items placed within while the lid remains open do not affect the weight or any other properties of the box.
When the lid is closed and locked, however, all items inside vanish irretrievably.
Personnel locked inside the box are also irretrievable,
although losing personnel in this fashion appears to affect significantly the dreams experienced by [DATA EXPUNGED].
