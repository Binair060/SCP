Space-Time Anomalies

SCP-004 seems to propagate spatiotemporal anomalies.
Personnel leaving the facility report losing time.
Those who have been in the site for weeks insist that they had only been in the facility for several days,
and records of work completed and supplies consumed support their claims.
Other temporal anomalies involve SCP-004-2 through -13,
especially the reappearance of SCP-004-CAS01 and SCP-004-CAS02 exactly ██ years after using SCP-004-██.
████████████████████ has been assigned to investigate all aspects of these time anomalies.
Spatial anomalies include the impossibly large dimensions of the area opened by SCP-004-7.
Similarly,
the 2003 blackout incident suggests that there exists an alternate plane of existence within the same space that Site-62 occupies.
