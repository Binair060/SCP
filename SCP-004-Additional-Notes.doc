Additional Notes

Testing on SCP-004 reveals that ten of the keys open SCP-004-1 on a dimension where the laws of physics and topology are significantly different than those of our home dimension.
Test subjects meeting these hostile conditions are torn apart,
their body parts deposited in various locations,
only three of which have been verified to be on Earth.
Material deposited at two of these points appears immediately;
material deposited at the third appears exactly ██ years into the future.
The other seven locations are currently unknown.

Current testing focuses on two avenues of research.
The first is finding ways to survive SCP-004’s hostile topologies.
The second [DATA EXPUNGED] suggest that SCP-004-2 through -13 may open doors other than SCP-004-1.
