Appendix A:

While SCP-005 has been shown to be effective in removing almost any form of locking device,
further experiments have shown that efforts to disguise the purpose or identity of a lock have proven at least somewhat successful in defeating SCP-005's ability.
In approximately 50% of cases where a volunteer was not able to identify a locking device as such,
SCP-005 was not successful in deactivating the device.
Due to these results,
SCP-005 has been tentatively classified as 'sentient' and further tests are being run to determine its cognitive abilities.
However, there are no results that show any traits that prevent it from being able to identify any particular locking device,
only that the aforementioned device has been heavily concealed and disguised.
