Description:
In appearance, SCP-005 resembles an ornate key, displaying the characteristics of a typical mass produced key used in the 1920s.
The key was discovered when a civilian used it to infiltrate a high security facility.
SCP-005 seems to have the unique ability to open any and all forms of lock (See Appendix A),
be they mechanical or digital, with relative ease. The origin of this ability has yet to be determined.
