Addendum 003-01:

Acting on information gathered from linguistic analysis of SCP-003-2's runes and comparative data analysis,
Research Team M03-Gloria has managed to establish a link between SCP-003 and [DATA EXPUNGED] for analysis of functions.
SCP-003-1 must now be considered sentient,
and is to be kept a minimum of 1 km from [DATA EXPUNGED] and the resulting "by-product" at all times.
