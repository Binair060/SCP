Addendum 003-04:

The procedure detailed in Addendum 003-03 was repeated, and SCP-003-1 again entered a growth state.
After 10 minutes and 13 seconds, SCP-003-2 once again produced a sustained radiation spike.
SCP-003-1's growth stopped for 36 seconds, then resumed at its previous pace.

On quadrupling its mass, SCP-003-1 formed a coherent outer shell and body.
After appearing to scan its environment and partially converting its environment,
SCP-003-1 then breached containment, entering the observation gallery where nine members of M03-Gloria were present.
On physical contact with team members, SCP-003-1 encompassed them in rapidly-grown appendages and stopped growth for 15 minutes.
SCP-003-1 then resumed growth, and rearranged the component parts of the center of its form to the shape of a three-meter-tall female humanoid,
with peripheral "tentacles" shifting to extrude primarily from SCP-003-1's newly formed "hair" and spine. SCP-003-1 then produced rudimentary vocalizations in an apparent initial attempt to communicate with researchers. [DATA EXPUNGED]

An unknown individual approached the compromised containment area in company of a full squad of agents.
The individual claimed to be acting on orders of O5-10 and attempted communication with SCP-003-1. [DATA EXPUNGED]

Following this incident,
Agent Jackson of M03-Gloria successfully restored power to SCP-003-2 and activated backup generators to return the temperature to 100°C.
SCP-003-1 returned to its normal state in 21 minutes and 7 seconds, and was successfully re-contained without incident.

All nine members of M03-Gloria affected by SCP-003-1 were afterwards found to be physically unharmed,
with no residual effects besides psychological trauma.
The converted materials of SCP-003's former containment area did not dissolve and are now under analysis.
