Because of this event's confluence with the recent breach of SCP-995, the opening of SCP-616, and the activation of SCP-098,
the Foundation is required to immediately begin preparations for an XK-class end-of-the-world scenario.
SCP-076 and SCP-073 are to be secured immediately. All personnel are to unlock and decode Emergency Order Patmos-Omega,
and follow all orders within. Site 19 is to be secured, and all nonessential SCPs and personnel terminated and/or destroyed.

Upon contacting Site 0, O5-14 responded that no such message had been sent from his location and that SCP-001 remained inert.
The transmission was initially determined to be a hoax. However,
close examination of the transmission reveals a timestamp dated [DATA REDACTED] years in the future.
It is theorized that [DATA EXPUNGED].
