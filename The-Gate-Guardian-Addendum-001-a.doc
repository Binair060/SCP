Addendum 001-a: Experimentation re: SCP-001-2's effective kill range

1. EXPERIMENT A:
1 Class-D personnel instructed to approach SCP-001 as closely as possible on foot.

Result:
Upon making visual contact with SCP-001, subject is ordered to "LEAVE."
Subject immediately turns away from entity and walks away.
Despite repeated orders to continue the experiment, Class D Personnel refuses to obey and is terminated.
Upon termination of Class-D personnel, all research staff involved are immediately obliterated by an unknown force,
presumably SCP-001-2.


2. EXPERIMENT B:
1 remote-operated research robot guided to approach SCP-001 from the ground.

Result:Upon approaching within 1 km of SCP-001, research robot is obliterated, presumably by SCP-001-2.
All further attempts at remote reconnaissance have the same result.


3. EXPERIMENT C:
100 pre-programmed research drones instructed to approach SCP-001 from multiple angles simultaneously.

Result:
Coordination is successful, and all 100 drones cross the 1 km mark simultaneously;
however, all 100 are simultaneously obliterated by SCP-001-2.
Designated observer at Site 0 reports that SCP-001-2 appeared to "strike in all directions at once."
SCP-001 did not deviate from its stance while this took place.


4. EXPERIMENT D:
Wire-guided missile fired from a distance of 3 km.

Result: SCP-001-2 obliterates weapon upon crossing the 1km mark,
simultaneously obliterating the launch site and killing all personnel.


5. EXPERIMENT E:
Multi-Warhead Intercontinental Ballistic Missile fired from SCP nuclear submarine "Nautilus."

Result:
See Indian Ocean Submarine Missile Experiment, December 26, 2004


6. EXPERIMENT F:
SCP-076 and Task Force Omega 7 instructed to approach SCP-001 on foot.

Result:
SCP-076 refuses to carry out mission, despite not being informed of the mission's nature.
Upon being asked why, SCP-076 replies, "No. Just no."


7. EXPERIMENT G:
SCP-073. Due to the results of experiment F, SCP-073 was not informed of his destination until arriving at Site 0.

Result:
SCP-073 approached the site on foot. Upon seeing SCP-001, SCP-073 became distressed and asked to abort.
SCP-073 was ordered to continue. At that point, the symbol on SCP-073's forehead became [DATA EXPUNGED].
Experiment was terminated due to [DATA EXPUNGED]. See Addendum 001-aa.
